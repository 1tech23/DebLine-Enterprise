    <title>About The Founder</title>
    <img src="TheFounder4.jpg" type="image/jpg" alt="This Is The Founder of DebLine Industries" width="500" height="300">
    <p>This is Logan Alldredge, being a bit of an idiot, with his camera.</p>
    <p>Mailing address: 300 19th Street, Evanston, Wyoming, 82930</p>
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>-----------------------</p>
    <p>Logan started his career at a McDonald's restaurant, where he began earning the money (very slowly) to fund his program, and began the  creation of DebLine OS. At that point, he had had three laptops with DebLine OS base systems installed, running software rendering Cinnamon Window Manager (by Debian Linux) and inserting thousands of lines of Linux code in the command line. He then built this website, all eight-hunred lines.</p>
    <p>He learned the Debian language when he was about twelve, and began working with it on XFCE4, a Debian-based desktop environment, as a dual boot with Chrome OS on an Acer Chromebook 11. He then broke that laptop, and got a fifteen-year old laptop called an Acer Aspire 5520 series laptop. He installed Debian Linux 8 on it, then upgraded to Debian Linux 10. He then dual-booted DebLine, and a slightly deprecated and changed edition of Windows 10 (allows running DebLine while running Windows 10, simultaneously, without overheating or taking up lots of data)</p>
    <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>He also took Automotive classes when he was 16.</p>
